Here I publish my [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) solutions.  
Codewars is a site about solving programming tasks designed in Japanese style: 
* Tasks are called [*kata*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata)s 
* Katas are grouped by difficulty in 8 [*kyu*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ky%C5%AB): from 8 — white, the simpliest; to 1 — black, the most difficult.
